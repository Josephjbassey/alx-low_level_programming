# 0x02. C - Functions, nested loops

This project focuses on understanding functions and nested loops in C programming. Below are the tasks and their descriptions for this project:

## Resources

- [Nested while loops](#)
- [C - Functions](#)
- [Learning to Program in C (Part 06)](#)
- [What is the purpose of a function prototype?](#)
- [C - Header Files](#)

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Understand nested loops and how to use them.
- Comprehend the concept of functions and their usage.
- Differentiate between the declaration and definition of a function.
- Explain what a prototype is.
- Understand the scope of variables.
- Familiarize yourself with the gcc flags `-Wall -Werror -pedantic -Wextra -std=gnu89`.
- Learn how to work with header files using `#include`.

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc with the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- All your files should end with a new line
- You must include a README.md file at the root of the project folder
- Your code should follow the Betty style guidelines
- No global variables allowed
- Maximum of 5 functions per file
- You are not allowed to use standard library functions such as printf, puts, etc.
- You can use `_putchar` for output
- Do not push `_putchar.c` as it will not be considered
- Prototype of all functions and the `_putchar` function should be included in the `main.h` header file

## Tasks

1. [_putchar](0-putchar.c)
   - Write a program that prints `_putchar`, followed by a new line. The program should return 0.

2. [I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game](1-alphabet.c)
   - Write a function that prints the lowercase alphabet, followed by a new line. You can only use `_putchar` twice in your code.

3. [10 x alphabet](2-print_alphabet_x10.c)
   - Write a function that prints the lowercase alphabet 10 times, followed by a new line. You can only use `_putchar` twice in your code.

4. [islower](3-islower.c)
   - Write a function that checks if a character is a lowercase letter. Returns 1 if it is, 0 otherwise.

5. [isalpha](4-isalpha.c)
   - Write a function that checks if a character is an alphabetic character (lowercase or uppercase). Returns 1 if it is, 0 otherwise.

6. [Sign](5-sign.c)
   - Write a function that prints the sign of a number. Returns 1 and prints '+' if the number is greater than zero, 0 and prints '0' if it is zero, -1 and prints '-' if it is less than zero.

7. [There is no such thing as absolute value in this world. You can only estimate what a thing is worth to you](6-abs.c)
   - Write a function that computes the absolute value of an integer.

8. [There are only 3 colors, 10 digits, and 7 notes; it's what we do with them that's important](7-print_last_digit.c)
   - Write a function that prints the last digit of a number. Returns the value of the last digit.

9. [I'm federal agent Jack Bauer, and today is the longest day of my life](8-24_hours.c)
   - Write a function that prints every minute of the day of Jack Bauer, from 00:00 to 23:59.

10. [Learn your times table](9-times_table.c)
    - Write a function that prints the 9 times table, starting from 0.

11. [a + b](10-add.c)
    - Write a function that adds two integers and returns the result.

12. [98 Battery Street, the OG](11-print_to_98.c)
    - Write a function that prints all natural numbers from a given number `n` to 98, followed by a new line.

13. [The World looks like a multiplication-table, or a mathematical equation, which, turn it how you will, balances itself (advanced)](100-times_table.c)
    - Write a function that prints the multiplication table up to `n`. If `n` is greater than 15 or less than 0, the function should not print anything.

14. [In computer class, the first assignment was to write a program to print the first 100 Fibonacci numbers. Instead, I wrote a program that would steal passwords of students. My teacher gave me an A (advanced)](101-natural.c)
    - Write a program that computes and prints the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1024 (excluded), followed by a new line.

15. [Even Liber Abbaci (advanced)](102-fibonacci.c)
    - Write a program that prints the first 50 Fibonacci numbers, starting with 1 and 2, followed by a new line.

16. [In computer class, the first assignment was to write a program to print the first 100 Fibonacci numbers. Instead, I wrote a program that would steal passwords of students. My teacher gave me an A+ (advanced)](103-fibonacci.c)
    - Write a program that finds and prints the first 98 Fibonacci numbers, starting with 1 and 2, followed by a new line.
