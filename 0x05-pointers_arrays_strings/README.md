# 0x05. C - Pointers, arrays and strings

## Description
The "0x05. C - Pointers, arrays and strings" project is designed to reinforce your knowledge of C programming by focusing on concepts related to pointers, arrays, and strings. This project builds upon the fundamentals you learned in previous projects and introduces more advanced topics.

## Learning Objectives
By completing this project, you should be able to:

- Understand and use pointers effectively.
- Work with arrays in C and manipulate them.
- Differentiate between pointers and arrays.
- Manipulate and work with strings in C.
- Gain a deeper understanding of variable scope.
- Utilize compiler flags like `-Wall -Werror -pedantic -Wextra -std=gnu89`.
- Organize your code with header files and the `#include` directive.


## Project Files

### 0-reset_to_98.c
- [0-reset_to_98.c](0-reset_to_98.c)
- This file contains a function that takes a pointer to an int as a parameter and updates the value it points to to 98.

### 1-swap.c
- [1-swap.c](1-swap.c)
- This file contains a function that swaps the values of two integers.

### 2-strlen.c
- [2-strlen.c](2-strlen.c)
- This file contains a function that returns the length of a string.

### 3-puts.c
- [3-puts.c](3-puts.c)
- This file contains a function that prints a string, followed by a new line, to stdout.

### 4-print_rev.c
- [4-print_rev.c](4-print_rev.c)
- This file contains a function that prints a string in reverse, followed by a new line.

### 5-rev_string.c
- [5-rev_string.c](5-rev_string.c)
- This file contains a function that reverses a string.

### 6-puts2.c
- [6-puts2.c](6-puts2.c)
- This file contains a function that prints every other character of a string, starting with the first character, followed by a new line.

### 7-puts_half.c
- [7-puts_half.c](7-puts_half.c)
- This file contains a function that prints half of a string, followed by a new line. If the number of characters is odd, it prints the last n characters of the string, where n = (length_of_the_string - 1) / 2.

### 8-print_array.c
- [8-print_array.c](8-print_array.c)
- This file contains a function that prints n elements of an array of integers, followed by a new line.

### 9-strcpy.c
- [9-strcpy.c](9-strcpy.c)
- This file contains a function that copies the string pointed to by src, including the terminating null byte (\0), to the buffer pointed to by dest.

### 100-atoi.c
- [100-atoi.c](100-atoi.c)
- This file contains a function that converts a string to an integer.

### 101-keygen.c
- [101-keygen.c](101-keygen.c)
- This file contains a program that generates random valid passwords for the program 101-crackme.

### main.h
- [main.h](main.h)
- This header file contains function prototypes used in the project's main files.
