## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you will be able to:

- Understand and use arithmetic operators, logical operators, and relational operators in C.
- Work with if and if...else statements to control program flow.
- Declare and assign values to variables of types char, int, and unsigned int.
- Print variable values using printf.
- Utilize the while loop and work with variables within the loop.
- Familiarize yourself with the ASCII character set.

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc with specific flags.
- Code should follow the Betty style guidelines.
- A README.md file at the root of the project folder.
- No errors or warnings during compilation.
- Do not use the system function.

## Tasks

Here's a list of the tasks in this project:

1. **Positive anything is better than negative nothing**
   - This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. It prints whether the number is positive, zero, or negative.
   - [Task 0 file](./0-positive_or_negative.c)

2. **The last digit**
   - This program assigns a random number to n and prints its last digit.
   - [Task 1 file](./1-last_digit.c)

3. **I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game**
   - Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase.
   - [Task 2 file](./2-print_alphabet.c)

4. **alphABET**
   - Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase and uppercase.
   - [Task 3 file](./3-print_alphabets.c)

5. **When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off**
   - Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, excluding 'q' and 'e'.
   - [Task 4 file](./4-print_alphabt.c)

6. **Numbers**
   - Write a program that prints all single-digit numbers in base 10.
   - [Task 5 file](./5-print_numbers.c)

7. **Numberz**
   - Write a program that prints all single-digit numbers in base 10 without using `char` data type.
   - [Task 6 file](./6-print_numberz.c)

8. **Smile in the mirror**
   - Write a program that prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse.
   - [Task 7 file](./7-print_tebahpla.c)

9. **Hexadecimal**
   - Write a program that prints all numbers of base 16 in lowercase.
   - [Task 8 file](./8-print_base16.c)

10. **Patience, persistence, and perspiration make an unbeatable combination for success**
    - Write a program that prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers.
    - [Task 9 file](./9-print_comb.c)

11. **Inventing is a combination of brains and materials. The more brains you use, the less material you need**
    - Write a program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits.
    - [Task 10 file](./100-print_comb3.c)

12. **The success combination in business is: Do what you do better... and: do more of what you do...**
    - Write a program that prints all possible different combinations of three digits.
    - [Task 11 file](./101-print_comb4.c)

13. **Software is eating the World**
    - Write a program that prints all possible combinations of two two-digit numbers.
    - [Task 12 file](./102-print_comb5.c)
