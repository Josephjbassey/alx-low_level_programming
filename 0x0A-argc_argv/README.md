# 0x0A. C - argc, argv

This project focuses on learning how to work with command-line arguments in C using the `argc` and `argv` parameters of the `main` function. It also covers topics like unused variables and function parameters. Here's a summary of what you'll find in this project:

## Resources

- [Arguments to main](https://publications.gbdirect.co.uk//c_book/chapter10/arguments_to_main.html)
- [argc and argv](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/command-line-arguments-in-c-cpp/)
- [What does argc and argv mean?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3024197/what-does-int-argc-char-argv-mean)
- [How to compile with unused variables](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2955994/why-does-gcc-not-say-that-my-variable-is-unused)
- [C - Argument Count (argc) and Argument Vector (argv)](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/c_command_line_arguments.htm)

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you will be able to:

- Understand how to use arguments passed to your program.
- Know the two prototypes of the `main` function and when to use one or the other.
- Learn how to use `__attribute__((unused))` or `(void)` to compile functions with unused variables or parameters.

## Tasks

Here's a list of the tasks in this project:

1. **It ain't what they call you, it's what you answer to**
   - Write a program that prints its name, followed by a new line.
   - [Task 0 file](./0-whatsmyname.c)

2. **Silence is argument carried out by other means**
   - Write a program that prints the number of arguments passed into it.
   - [Task 1 file](./1-args.c)

3. **The best argument against democracy is a five-minute conversation with the average voter**
   - Write a program that prints all arguments it receives.
   - [Task 2 file](./2-args.c)

4. **Neither irony nor sarcasm is argument**
   - Write a program that multiplies two numbers.
   - [Task 3 file](./3-mul.c)

5. **To infinity and beyond**
   - Write a program that adds positive numbers.
   - [Task 4 file](./4-add.c)

6. **Minimal Number of Coins for Change**
   - Write a program that prints the minimum number of coins to make change for an amount of money.
   - [Task 100 file](./100-change.c)

Happy coding!
