# 0x04. C - More functions, more nested loops

## Description
The "0x04. C - More functions, more nested loops" project is designed to reinforce your knowledge of C programming by focusing on concepts related to functions and nested loops. This project builds upon the fundamentals you learned in previous projects and introduces more advanced topics.

## Learning Objectives
By completing this project, you should be able to:

- Understand and use nested loops effectively.
- Define and use functions in C.
- Differentiate between function declarations and definitions.
- Work with function prototypes.
- Gain a deeper understanding of variable scope.
- Utilize compiler flags like `-Wall -Werror -pedantic -Wextra -std=gnu89`.
- Work with header files and the `#include` directive.
