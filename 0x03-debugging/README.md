# 0x03. C - Debugging

## Description
Debugging is the process of finding and fixing errors in software that prevents it from running correctly. As you become a more advanced programmer and an industry engineer, you will learn how to use debugging tools such as gdb or built-in tools that IDEs have. However, itâ€™s important to understand the concepts and processes of debugging manually.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to explain:

- What debugging is.
- Methods of debugging manually.
- How to read error messages.

## Repository
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/josephjbassey/alx-low_level_programming/tree/main/0x03-debugging)

## Files

### 0-main.c
- [0-main.c](0-main.c)
- This file contains a test case for task 0. It checks that the function `positive_or_negative()` gives the correct output when given a case of 0.

### 1-main.c
- [1-main.c](1-main.c)
- This file contains a test case for task 1. It copies the main code and comments out the part of the code causing an infinite loop.


### 2-largest_number.c
- [2-largest_number.c](2-largest_number.c)
- This is the solution file for task 2. It contains the corrected code to print the largest of three integers.

### 3-convert_day.c
- [3-convert_day.c](3-convert_day.c)
- This file contains a helper function for task 3. It converts the day of the month to the day of the year, without accounting for leap years.

### 3-print_remaining_days.c
- [3-print_remaining_days.c](3-print_remaining_days.c)
- This is the solution file for task 3. It contains the corrected `print_remaining_days` function that correctly considers leap years and produces the correct output for all dates.

### main.h
- [main.h](main.h)
- This header file contains function prototypes used in the project's main files.

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the C files using a C compiler, e.g., `gcc`.
3. Run the compiled programs to test the tasks.
